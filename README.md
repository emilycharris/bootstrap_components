Bootstrap Components &amp; Multi View Application homework

Objective: Create a Django application that utilizes the bootstrap CSS library and has multiple views/urls

**Description**

You are the world's biggest fan of something. Don't try to hide it. In this assignment you will be challenged to create and design an application that conveys how much of a fan you are of this particular something.

**Objectives**

- Understand how to manage multiple url patterns with multiple views
- Understand how to manage multiple templates
- Understand how to utilize your models in your templates.

You will first have to decide what you are the biggest fan of. Is it kittens? A football team? A band? A pop singer? A NASCAR racer? Once you've settled on that you can begin to decide what kind of fan data your application will contain. I would like to see a model that well represents your understanding of what you are the biggest fan of. For example, if you're going to do a site dedicated to your favorite kittens, create a model where you can store information about individual kittens: Their name, their coloring, their disposition, favorite food, a url link to a photo of them.

Now that you've settled on what kind of data you'd like to store, you will need to create some views and templates to display your huge fandom. The exact requirements are listed below. Within these parameters - feel free to be creative! Being fearless with UI elements will not work against you in any way.

Requirements

- You must link twitter bootstrap into your base.html with https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/.
- You must utilize bootstrap UI components to "jazz up" the design of your site. http://getbootstrap.com/components/ (Warning: some of these require use of Bootstrap's javascript library, which in turn requires jquery... so choose wisely)
- A minimum of 3 pages to navigate to.
- A "home" page that contains an overview of what you're a fan of
- A "detailed info" page that contains all of the details that you're storing in the database.
- An "about me" page where you list a short biography of yourself. You can fabricate data on this if you are uncomfortable writing about yourself. Make up an alter-ego if you must.
- All pages must contain a link to the other pages. (Think like a menu)
- A minimum of one model to store data in to.
- The Django admin page must be accessible to create new instances of your models.

To complete the requirements of this assignment, I set up a fan page for the Duke Blue Devils using Python and Django and formatted with Bootstrap.
